					<p>
						Hello, I'm Jeffrey. I work as a Delivery Management Analyst for Conduent, located in Melville, NY.
						I graduated with a BSc in Applied Mathematics & Statistics from Stony Brook University in May, 2018.
						I am interested in working in an analytic position, either as a Business Analyst, Data Analyst, or continuing to work as an Product Support Analyst.

					</p>
					<p>
						When I'm not working, you may find me listening to music, playing with one of my guitars, in a yoga class, or writing programs to fulfill my random needs.

					<u><h4>Conduent (formerly Health Solutions Plus) <i class="dates"><u>June 2018-present</u></i></h4></u>
					<p>
						At Conduent (<i>formerly Health Solutions Plus</i>), I was initialy hired as a Quality Assurance Analyst.
						Most of my testing was manual, but there was some API testing performed through Postman as well.
					</p>
					<p>
						After a few months, I joined the Client Services where I still work as a Delivery Management Analyst.
						Our clients are healthcare insurance companies. When they believe a defect has been found, they submit a service ticket. I work with severfal of these clients and have built a rapport with them by providing swift and clear communication on investigation progress.
						If the reported isssue is found to not be a defect, I explain this and provide training to the client if necessary.
						If the issue is a defect, I attempt to find the root cause of the issue, and whether or not it is related to recent changes or a version upgrade.
						This information is then relayed to our development team to fix the bugs for upcoming release, and when possible, write a script in SQL to resolve the issue.
					</p>
					<p>
						When we cannot write a script for the client, and it is an issue preventing the client from operating as expected, I do my best to attempt to come up with a workaround for the client.
						This helps to prevent the client from encountering this issue again, and also provides a fast and easy solution if another client reports the same issue.
						Communication is mainly handled through email, but occasionally I will get on a call via Microsoft Teams to gather information from the client, troubleshoot issues we cannot reproduce in local environments, or allow development to deploy changes into the client's environment remotely.
					</p>
					<p>
						Although this role is different from what I was initially hired into, I've come to enjoy the challenges of understanding what the client is reported and how the issue occurs. I I've also become very comfortable with querying databse tables via SQL Server to investigate these issues.
