					Hello, I'm Jeffrey and I currently work reside in Copiague, NY. I have experience in client-facing product support and quality assurance testing for software used by healthcare insurance companies. 

				</p>
				<p>
					When I'm not working, you may find me listening to music, playing with one of my guitars, in a yoga class, or coding to fulfill my random needs (like this site).

				<h3><u>Conduent</u> <em>(formerly Health Solutions Plus)</em> <i class="dates">June 2018-present</i></h3>
				<p>
					I've been working here since I graduated from Stony Brook University, with most of my time spent as a Delivery Management Analyst.
					Initially, I was hired by <a href="https://www.hspweb.com/" target="_blank">Health Solutions Plus</a>, a company that provides a suite of software applications for healthcare insurance companies to store data on members and groups, and automate the submission and payment of claims and bills. 
					My first role was as a Quality Assurance Analyst intern, and I was offered a fulltime position following this internship. 
					A couple months later, I was invited to join the Client Services department as Junior Product Specialist.
					...And then we were acquired, where my department and job roles stayed the same, but my title was changed to Delivery Management Analyst.
				</p>
				<ul><li><h4>Delivery Management Analyst<i class="dates">October 2018-present</i></h4></li>
				<p>
					Since moving to this department in October 2018, I've built a rapport with about a dozen of these companies, reviewing their reported defects.
					Sometimes, these issues are the result of bad data that needs to be cleaned up via a script, sometimes they've found a new bug and a bug fix is created,
					and sometimes, there is a misunderstanding and I provide training to the client. 
					After investigating over 100 of these, I've learned a lot about the Heatlhcare Insurance Payer Domain and how to communicate both with clients and our developers.
				
				I've also learned how to prioritize tickets, some days have a larger influx of tickets than others, which requires understanding the business needs of each ticket
				- a dropdown box populating when its parent hasn't had a value assigned is negligible;
				bills being due in a couple of weeks when not all records are being created is not!</p>
				<p>My investigations are done in several ways - analyzing XML error logs, 
					querying client databases with Microsoft SQL Server, 
					logging onto our company's software remotely and reviewing in the client's environment, 
					and attempting to reproduce with local data. 
					This last method is especially valuable as it is easier to reproduce in bug fixes for both Development and QA, although it is not always doable.
				</p>
				Communications are done through email or phone via Microsoft Teams, with positive reception from clients for my clear and fast communications, as well as instructions provided during training write-ups.
				We've also gained some new employees this year, and I've had the pleasure of providing some training to them.
				It's been a fun experience, both to help them, and realize that I understand some things better than I had initially thought.
				Additionally, I also will occasionally perform software testing, with emphasis on files going into custom code lines for clients. 
				These files tend to be financials related, and I also had experience testing new Medicare Advantage functionality, 
				with my testing notes and batch files being used by the Implementation Team to train one of our onboarding clients.
			</p>
			</ul>

		<ul><li><h4>Quality Assurance Analyst<i class="dates">July 2018-September 2018</i></h4>

		</li>
			<p>
				Initially I was hired as a summer intern, but my clear testing notes and curiousity to about SQL and different types of testing convinced the QA manager to offer me a fulltime job.
				Although I was not in this department for very long, I had a good experience here, &#8211 learning about different testing methodologies and ways of documenting notes (simple Word writeups, test matrices).
				It was also valuable to communicate with Development in order to determine the root cause of issues, which was a very good experience to have once I was moved to Customer Service, where it happens quite often.
				My testing was mostly manual, along with some API testing via Postman (XML and JSON used for requests).
